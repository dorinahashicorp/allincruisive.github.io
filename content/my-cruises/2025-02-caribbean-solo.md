My first solo cruise experience in the Caribbean in February 2025 - an introspective adventure surrounded by azure views.

## Overview

I travelled to Las Vegas for my company's annual sales kick off and took the opportunity to extend my stay by visiting the Carribean via a Norwegian Cruise Line cruise. I was travelling by myself so this became my first solo cruising experience. It was one week in total and I loved warming up my bones in those exotic destinations in the middle of winder. 

## The Ship & My Cabin

The ship was Norwegian EPIC. It was much bigger than my previous CUnard experience, and you could definitely feel the weight of the crowds, especially on embarkation and disembarkation. I had a cosy inside solo cabin with no window but with lovely color shifting mood lights. For its size, I had a very comfortable bed which made ofr some very restful sleep. 

## Solo Travel Experience

It was one of the most meditative travelling experiences I ever had. I had lots of time to myself and space to immerse myself in the beautiful places I visited. Some of the clear blue beaches looked surreal when seeing so up close. Like one of those moments where, if you have someone with you, you might say "is this real? Pinch me"
