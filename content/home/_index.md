Welcome to **AllinCruisive** - a brain dump for my cruise obsessions. 
This will include highlights from my actual - though very occasional - cruises and random cruise-related ideas outside of that.

Opinions on cruising can be very divided: some love the dynamicity of it, some hate the perceived 'over-the-top' aspect.
I find cruises both entirely fascinating (some are so heckin' big and ridiculous) and also very efficient. I just love waking up someplace new without taking a plane or a train and a nice, daily schedule.

The idea for the name came to me one afternoon when I randomly stuttered in a conversation, saying 'allincruisive' instead of 'all inclusive cruising'. Absolutely genius.
