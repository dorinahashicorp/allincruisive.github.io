Welcome to **AllinCruisive** - a safe place to store my cruise obsessions. 
This will include highlights from my actual - though very occasional - cruises and random cruise-related ideas outside of that.

Opinions on cruising can be very divided: some love the dynamicity of it, some hate the perceived 'over-the-top' aspect.
I find cruises both entirely fascinating (some are so heckin' big and ridiculous) and also very efficient. I just love waking up someplace new without taking a plane or a train. 

I don't know how long this fascination will last but for now, I'll store all my thoughts and memories about it here, all in all, allincruisive :P.
