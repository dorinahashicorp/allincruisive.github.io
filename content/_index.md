Welcome to **AllinCruisive** - a brain dump for my cruise trips and thoughts.

One day I took my first ever cruise, and life would never be the same again. 
Opinions on cruising can be very divided: some love the dynamicity of it, some hate the perceived 'over-the-top' aspect. But cruising, as life itself, is what you make of it.

I find cruises both entirely fascinating (some are so heckin' big and ridiculous) and also very efficient. I just love waking up someplace new without taking a plane or a train. And I love a schedule, which cruises are very good at, especially on sea days. 

The idea for the name came to me one afternoon when I randomly stuttered in a conversation to my husband, saying 'allincruisive' instead of 'all inclusive cruising'. Absolutely genius.

This is a lifelong project. Cheers to plentiful experiences ✺◟(＾∇＾)◞✺
