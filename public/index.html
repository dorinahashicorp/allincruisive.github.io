  <p>Welcome to <strong>AllinCruisive</strong> - a safe place to store my cruise obsessions.
This will include highlights from my actual - though very occasional - cruises and random cruise-related ideas outside of that.</p>
<p>Opinions on cruising can be very divided: some love the dynamicity of it, some hate the perceived &lsquo;over-the-top&rsquo; aspect.
I find cruises both entirely fascinating (some are so heckin&rsquo; big and ridiculous) and also very efficient. I just love waking up someplace new without taking a plane or a train.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long this fascination will last but for now, I&rsquo;ll store all my thoughts and memories about it here, all in all, allincruisive :P.</p>
