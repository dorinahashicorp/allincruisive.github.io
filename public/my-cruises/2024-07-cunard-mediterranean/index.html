        <p>My very first cruise experience was in July 2024 aboard the Queen Victoria, sailing through the stunning Mediterranean. We departed from Barcelona on July 15th and ended in Civitavecchia, visiting and eating our way through some fabulous port cities along the way.</p>
<h2 id="the-ship--my-room">The Ship &amp; My Room</h2>
<p>I sailed on Cunard&rsquo;s Queen Victoria and managed to score a lovely balcony room through bidding for upgrades. Sitting on that balcony in the warm Mediterranean breeze was magical. We took some amazing pictures there, and it became a favourite spot on the ship.</p>
<h2 id="itinerary">Itinerary</h2>
<p>Our Mediterranean route included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Barcelona, Spain</strong> (embarkation)</li>
<li><strong>Alghero, Sardinia</strong></li>
<li><strong>Ajaccio, Corsica</strong></li>
<li><strong>Messina, Sicily</strong></li>
<li><strong>Naples, Italy</strong></li>
<li><strong>Civitavecchia, Italy</strong> (disembarkation)</li>
</ul>
<p>The weather was super hot - almost too hot - and things were definitely very touristy, but that&rsquo;s the Mediterranean in July for you.</p>
<h2 id="a-birthday-at-sea">A Birthday at Sea</h2>
<p>One of the highlights was celebrating my birthday on July 20th during the cruise. I received a happy birthday note sent to my stateroom signed by the captain, which was a cute touch.</p>
<h2 id="first-time-in-italy">First Time in Italy</h2>
<p>This cruise was also my first time visiting Italy, and I finally got to experience what I hope was authentic Italian food. The canolis were delicious! There&rsquo;s something special about waking up someplace new and stepping off the ship to explore, and it was my first time experiencing it for myself.</p>
<h2 id="the-cunard-experience">The Cunard Experience</h2>
<p>The ship had a very distinct demographic - definitely a lot of older people, mostly posh folks having a lovely time in their retirement or golden years. The British traditions on board were everywhere, from the activities to the food. There was a flower arrangement workshop that got many British ladies very excited, and of course there was afternoon tea as well as midnight cheese and biscuits available in the buffet. The biscuits were prevalent indeed; we had some left in our stateroom after the daily turn down service. Twice a day room service is also something I experienced for the first time on Cunard.
The ship&rsquo;s decor was in line with its demographic: I&rsquo;d call it rustic and vintage. A lot of dark, red undertones.</p>
<h2 id="praise-the-schedule">Praise the schedule!</h2>
<p>I had a fun time browsing the daily schedule of activities planned on the ship and sitting on the balcony pondering what I may want to enjoy next. I love a good plan, even on vacation, especially if someone else does the planning.</p>
<h2 id="meh-moments">&lsquo;Meh&rsquo; Moments</h2>
<p>Cunard has its charm, but it&rsquo;s definitely too formal for me, especially when not being deemed formal enough does not allow you into the main restaurant (boo-hoo poor posh folks put in the unfortunate scenario of having to watch someone less dressed up ;) . I get it though, for people who actively seek out the experience, they want to feel fully immersed in it, so I&rsquo;m not complaining.
And being on boars with older, more fragile people, you can&rsquo;t get too shocked when someone will inevitably have a &lsquo;bathroom&rsquo; accident in a public place.
The main dining rooms, though lovely to sit in, paled in comparison to the buffet when it came to the quality of the food. I find with cruises in general, people go to the main dining rooms for the feeling of being looked after and a bit &rsquo;extra&rsquo;, while the food itself tends to be as much if not even better in the buffet. One of my favourite things to each is eggs royal/bennedict. I got some for the breakfast on my birthday and one of the eggs was missing a yolk ˙◠˙</p>
<h2 id="final-thoughts">Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>I used to hear negative things about cruising in the past, about how it&rsquo;s overly lavish, unsustainable, etc, etc. But when I finally did it for myself, I was surprised how much I enjoyed it and wanted to come back again. It is impressive how it all functions as a self-contained ecosystem and gets passengers so efficiently from one place to the next.</p>
